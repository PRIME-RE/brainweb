# PRIME-RE BrainWeb

A permanent space for the primate neuroscience community find collaborators, projects and start working together. 

Over the last years, the non-human primate neuroimaging community has formed and built the [Primate Data Exchange (PRIME-DE](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/indiPRIME.html), [Milham et al. 2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.08.039), [2020](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.12.023) as well as the [Primate Resource exchange (PRIME-RE](https://github.com/PRIME-RE/prime-re.github.io), [Messinger et al. 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117519) to share data, tools and experience. PrimeDRE-Web has been created to add a community component that allows to find collaborators and projects across labs.
The PrimeDRE-Web is part of the larger [BrainWeb](https://brain-web.github.io) and you can explore the larger network beyond primates.
